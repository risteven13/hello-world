The repository for Hunt's Hens.
DAY 1:
We teamed with Luke Hunt, who actually sells eggs to the community by word of mouth, to bring Luke’s egg business to the web. This was a perfect opportunity to expand his business and make an amazing website. We came up with 6 aspects of information for our webpage. Those are Home, Order, History, Chickens, Reviews, and Contact. We decided on the title of Hunt’s Hens. Hunt’s mission statement - work in progress. 


DAY 2:
Mission statement:
Hunt’s Hens is dedicated to providing fresh, free range, organic cage free eggs and exceptional service to all of our customers…. Our management system encourages team motivation, maintaining quality service in all aspects of our business.
Continued wireframing other pages and coding homepage

DAY 3:
History- I could never find eggs that met the standards that I longed for, eggs that come from free range, cage free, non GMO, organic, herb fed chickens. I decided that I would raise chickens of my own and meet all of those standards along with a fancy, custom, hand-stamped egg carton. Our chickens are kept healthy with over 20 varieties of garden grown herbs including oregano, mint, sage, lemon balm, bee balm, lavender, rosemary, thyme, basil, parsley, dill, catnip, peppermint, and multiple varieties of some. 
Today we finished and turned in our wireframe.

DAY 4: 
Today we hoped to achieve adding the pictures, but Luke wasn’t able to get them. We plan to finish the coding of the order page and the history page.
We completed the coding of the order page, we’re still working on the history page.

DAY 5:
Today we will start coding the chicken page, and finish the history page.
Unfortunately we ran into a big problem, we can only have up to 10 code pages. So that means five pages of html and five pages of css.



DAY 6:
Today we asked Ms. Kim for help with the limit issue. We linked all of our css together and fixed the file limit problem. We had some kind of issue with saving our work and everything got deleted. This means we have to start over. 



DAY 7:
Today we will be working on the coding of the history page… again. We added placeholder pictures until Luke can get them to us. We’re skipping the chicken page because Luke isn’t here and we don’t have any information about chickens. We’ve started coding the review page. 
We altered the font, changed the background, and finished the history page. 


DAY 8:
Today we will be working on changing the color scheme and finish coding a few more pages.

DAY 9:

 Today we worked on adding pictures to the project. Annabelle wasn’t here and riley almost had a panic attack. 

DAY 10:
Today we are continuing to add and adjust pictures. Luke emailed a few teachers he previously sold eggs to, here’s his email to them.




Luke’s Email for Reviews:
  “ Since I’ve previously sold eggs to you, would you mind writing a quick review about the egg quality, color, standards, etc. We are working on a website in Ms. Kim’s class, and your reviews would be very useful to add to our website. 
Thank you for your time, Luke Hunt. “

DAY 11:
Today we’re going to adjust the coding of the navbar. We got the navbar completed and adjusted and edited a few pictures.


DAY 12:
Today we are working on pictures and the chickens and reviews page. We got the reviews back from his customers! 

I have been a happy customer for the past two years. I feel like I know Coco, Snowflake, Lavender and Big Mama personally.  Luke's chickens have to be the luckiest chickens in the world. These chickens are feed organic food and live like Kings and Queens.

Thinking back on my first delivery- I was immediately impressed with the recyclable biodegradable square shaped cartoon.   Opening the carton brought a smile to my face.  Besides the beautifully colorful eggs, there was a note inside the top carton that read:  Laid by...and the cute, sweet names of Luke's chickens.  

Hunt's Hens produce healthy beautiful eggs and it is evident the first time you crack open his eggs. The shell is strong and the healthy beautiful yolk color is a rich and golden yellow. You know immediately that you are not eating an average egg.  His eggs are some of the best eggs that I have ever eaten. They are truly "fresh from the farm" and reasonably priced. I have not bought a "grocery" store egg since purchasing from Luke. I will not settle for less than the best and the quality is fabulous!  I love to cook and entertain in my home with many home cooked meals - my lake home guest have ranged from California to New York and they all are amazed that this 16 year old takes so much pride and care in his hens and they all are equally impressed with his story and the quality of these incredible eggs.

Thank you most of all for your environmental passion and for the incredible dishes I have the opportunity to produce.


Your eggs are of the highest quality.  I have never received a broken or cracked egg from you. These are the freshest eggs I have ever had. The color of the eggs are just "Martha Stewart" beautiful!  Not only do these eggs look like they are magazine worthy, the taste is remarkably fresh. There is just  no comparison to the flavor of these eggs. It is the difference between real butter and margarine.  It is very difficult for my family to eat any other brand of egg after enjoying these farm fresh eggs.  I appreciate all the hard work that goes into the care of your hens.  I know that they are probably some of the luckiest hens in world, because they lay some of the best eggs we have ever had.

Today we will continue to work on the coding of the review page and update a few pictures. We had a little issue adjusting the margins, but we figured it out.

DAY 22:
Today we’re adding finishing touches. We’re also completing other competition requirements. We added “Farm Fresh Eggs” between the title and the slogan. This gives customers a little more information about our business. 

DAY 23:
Today we’re completing the finishing touches. Our website is pretty much finished, but we’re going to run through it a few more times to see if we should add anything else.
