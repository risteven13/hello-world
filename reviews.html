            <h5 class="review">I have been a happy customer for the past two years. I feel like I know Coco, Lavender, Cotton Candy and Big Momma personally. Luke's chickens have to be the luckiest chickens in the world. These chickens are feed organic food and live like
              Kings and Queens. Thinking back on my first delivery- I was immediately impressed with the recyclable biodegradable square shaped cartoon. Opening the carton brought a smile to my face. Besides the beautifully colorful eggs, there was a
              note inside the top carton that read: Laid by...and the cute, sweet names of Luke's chickens. Hunt's Hens produce healthy beautiful eggs and it is evident the first time you crack open his eggs. The shell is strong and the healthy beautiful
              yolk color is a rich and golden yellow. You know immediately that you are not eating an average egg. His eggs are some of the best eggs that I have ever eaten. They are truly "fresh from the farm" and reasonably priced. I have not bought
              a "grocery" store egg since purchasing from Luke. I will not settle for less than the best and the quality is fabulous! I love to cook and entertain in my home with many home cooked meals - my lake home guests have ranged from California
              to New York and they all are amazed that this 16 year old takes so much pride and care in his hens and they all are equally impressed with his story and the quality of these incredible eggs. Thank you most of all for your environmental passion
              and for the incredible dishes I have the opportunity to produce!<br>

                          It is rare that for a few dollars you can get both a nutritious meal and a trip down memory lane all in one. However, the nutritious eggs from Luke Hunt and his hens bring you both. The rich mix of colors on the egg shells are indicative not only of the
                          beauty of his hens and the care provided to them but also of my childhood memories on my grandmother's farm where we would collect fresh eggs from her free range chickens for breakfast. Hunt farm's well feed, free range hens,
                          as indicated by the egg size, provide healthy eggs that meet the highest standards for my family. The egg cartons let me know from which hens my eggs come and are recycled, which also helps the environment. I love the fresh eggs
                          from Hunt farms and the personal touch provided with each carton. Delicious eggs, taking care of my family, and remembering my childhood all in one carton-exceptional!<br>

                                      Your eggs are of the highest quality. I have never received a broken or cracked egg from you. These are the freshest eggs I have ever had. The color of the eggs are just "Martha Stewart" beautiful! Not only do these eggs look like they are magazine worthy,
                                      the taste is remarkably fresh. There is just no comparison to the flavor of these eggs. It is the difference between real butter and margarine. It is very difficult for my family to eat any other brand of egg after
                                      enjoying these farm fresh eggs. I appreciate all the hard work that goes into the care of your hens. I know that they are probably some of the luckiest hens in world, because they lay some of the best eggs we have
                                      ever had.<br>
